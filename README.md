I made the following changes to the game:

Increased hero speed to 50, from 20.
Increased the roll when the hero ship moves- to -90, from -45.
Lowered speed of enemy 4, increased health to 15 and points you get when killing it- 15.
Added a new weapon type: MegaBullet. It is slow firing- high damage rate. 
Added a new enemy type: Star Destroyer from Star Wars. It moves slowly and is massive. Has 50 health. 

The game feels a lot more fast paced- the faster movement of the ship really changed the way you play it. You can now dodge ships faster, but at the same time if you aren't careful, you may run into one because you didn't realize how fast you were going. The increased roll gives it a faster feel too.

The star deestroyers are honestly intimidating- they are massive. I found these on a free unity package online and they look great. They have way more health than any other enemy.

Overall- I wanted to give this game more of a "star wars" feel- and I think I accomplished this.
